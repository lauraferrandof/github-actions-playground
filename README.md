# GitHub Actions playground

Hey there! This repo is just a playground to test GitHub Actions and learn to configure a CI pipeline for JavaScript projects. For the moment I'm following the [CodelyTV Pro GitHub Actions](https://pro.codely.tv/library/github-actions-de-0-a-integracion-continua/109857/about/) course üê£

Tips and advice are welcome! :)
